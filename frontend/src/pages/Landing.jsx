            <p>
              Moneytracer started as a simple idea: the tools that help a shop owner,
              a savings group treasurer, or someone budgeting their own salary
              shouldn't require an accounting degree or a spreadsheet. Whether you're
              running a hardware store, managing a chama's monthly contributions, or
              just trying to see where your money goes, Moneytracer gives you one
              clear, honest record you can trust.
            </p>
            <p>
              We built it for African businesses and communities first — with
              multi-currency support across the continent, offline-friendly workflows,
              and pricing that makes sense for a small business, not a global
              enterprise. No jargon, no bloated features you'll never use — just the
              numbers that matter, always up to date.
